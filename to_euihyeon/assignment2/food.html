            Kimchi is a preserved fermented food in Korea made by pickling cabbage and radish with coarse salt, washing it, and mixing seasonings such as red pepper powder, green onions, garlic, ginger, and salted fish. It is both a traditional Korean food and a representative food. There are many types of kimchi, but they can be used in general. For spicy kimchi, seasonings are high powder and salted fish, and in Korea, the manufacturing process and types vary slightly from region to region. It is also an officially designated food for the Olympics, Asian Games, and FIFA World Cup.
